## Introduction

Welcome to our revolutionary project aimed at creating an innovative keyboard solution catered specifically to the needs of the visually impaired. This keyboard generates characters with correct key combinations, accompanied by auditory cues that announce the typed character, providing an empowering typing experience.

## Control & Data Flow

### Data Flow

  <br>

### Giving Inputs

> The system employs a set of 10 pushbuttons for character input, with 8 buttons dedicated to character combinations and 2 buttons serving as essential controls for backspacing and inserting spaces. It facilitates communication between an ESP32 microcontroller and a PC through two primary connections: a USB connection for seamless data exchange and a Bluetooth connection for wireless communication. This setup allows for versatile and efficient text input and data transfer between the ESP32 device and a connected PC, offering both convenience and flexibility in various applications.

### Getting Outputs

> Serial output from the system is managed through Python scripts. The key libraries employed in this process include pyserial, which facilitates communication with the hardware, and pynput, enabling seamless integration of keyboard and mouse inputs. asyncio enhances asynchronous operations, ensuring smooth and efficient execution. Additionally, voice feedback is provided using pyttsx3, enhancing user interaction by adding vocal responses to system actions. These Python libraries collectively empower the system to offer comprehensive control, user-friendly input, and informative voice output for an enriched user experience.

## User Experince

- The system offers extensive character support, encompassing over 50 characters, including virtually all keys commonly found on a standard keyboard. This comprehensive range includes numbers and letters, both uppercase and lowercase, adhering to the standard Braille alphabet pattern for intuitive input. For special characters, users can simply type the character's name, aided by an efficient auto-searching and auto-filling system that condenses the process to a maximum of three letters, ensuring swift and accurate access to these additional characters.
- The system simplifies user interaction by adhering to standard Braille alphabet patterns, minimizing the need for complex memorization. It offers voice responses that provide real-time feedback to users as they press keys, enhancing the user experience and ensuring accuracy. Notably, after each word is input, the system offers a vocalized response of the complete word, allowing users to verify their input and reinforcing effective communication.
